# My-Portfolio
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news using advanced machine learning algorithms. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as either fake or real. The system helps combat misinformation by providing an automated and efficient solution.

🚀 Features

Advanced ML Algorithms: Implemented models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest for fake news classification.

NLP Integration: Tokenization, stemming, and vectorization using TfidfVectorizer.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use UI for users to input news articles for classification.

Real-Time Analysis: Predicts the authenticity of news articles in seconds.

Scalable: Ready for deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or Heroku.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Optional for visualization)


Deployment Tools: Docker, AWS/Heroku
